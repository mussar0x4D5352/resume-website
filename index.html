            You can also call me "Mussar". I'm a music teacher by day, hacker by night. This page will focus on data breaches, yadda yadda yadda, and etc. etc. etc. There's a lot of good information on the internet, and a bunch of it will wind up here. I'll also be including examples of my own work, which you can explore in more detail on my <a href="https://github.com/mussar0x4D5352" class="github">Github</a>.

                <h3>Free Speech = Twitter Source Code?</h3>
                <h4>2023/03/29</h4>
                <p>
                    Elon Musk loves free speech. He talks about it often enough that searching his Twitter page for the term gets over 800 distinct posts. He considers it the <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1627012484099108864">bedrock of democracy</a>, even. This is important, because Musk's purchase of the platform in October of last year was according to him in part to ensure the freedom of speech in matters regarding Twitter, where he now faces an important question: Does free speech extend to his company's source code?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This past week, a user with the aptly-chosen handle "FreeSpeechEnthusiast" uploaded portions of the Twitter source code to code repository GitHub. Within a few days, Twitter issued a DMCA takedown notice, and GitHub quickly removed the repository. As reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/26/technology/twitter-source-code-leak.html">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/27/23657928/twitter-source-code-leak-github">The Verge</a>, FreeSpeechEnthusiast's identity is still unknown, although Twitter is also attempting to compel GitHub to provide this information if they have it. Musk has said in the past that the source code would be revealed at the end of March, but has been relatively silent about the details of this particular leak.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Source code leaks are nothing new, of course. Microsoft and Steam are just two of the companies who have also suffered leaks in the past year. Proprietary code leaking is a mixed bag - on one hand, it allows malicious actors to find vulnerabilities to exploit and puts the security of the organization and/or its users at risk. On the other hand, it allows for a unique opportunity. If other organizations can learn from the leaks that occur, they can set up plans to plug those holes first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The battle between free speech and loose lips sinking ships rages, ever onwards.
