                <h3>Free Speech = Twitter Source Code?</h3>
                <h4>2023/03/29</h4>
                <p>
                    Elon Musk loves free speech. He talks about it often enough that searching his Twitter page for the term gets over 800 distinct posts. He considers it the <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1627012484099108864">bedrock of democracy</a>, even. This is important, because Musk's purchase of the platform in October of last year was according to him in part to ensure the freedom of speech in matters regarding Twitter, where he now faces an important question: Does free speech extend to his company's source code?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This past week, a user with the aptly-chosen handle "FreeSpeechEnthusiast" uploaded portions of the Twitter source code to code repository GitHub. Within a few days, Twitter issued a DMCA takedown notice, and GitHub quickly removed the repository. As reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/26/technology/twitter-source-code-leak.html">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/27/23657928/twitter-source-code-leak-github">The Verge</a>, FreeSpeechEnthusiast's identity is still unknown, although Twitter is also attempting to compel GitHub to provide this information if they have it. Musk has said in the past that the source code would be revealed at the end of March, but has been relatively silent about the details of this particular leak.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Source code leaks are nothing new, of course. Microsoft and Steam are just two of the companies who have also suffered leaks in the past year. Proprietary code leaking is a mixed bag - on one hand, it allows malicious actors to find vulnerabilities to exploit and puts the security of the organization and/or its users at risk. On the other hand, it allows for a unique opportunity. If other organizations can learn from the leaks that occur, they can set up plans to plug those holes first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The battle between free speech and loose lips sinking ships rages, ever onwards.

                <h3>From Passwords to Passphrases</h3>
                <h4>2023/03/29</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a small write-up on a tool I've been developing with the project name "Readable Nicephrases." Written in Python, it aims to help steer people away from passwords, which struggle with balancing security with ease of use, and towards more resilient methods of authentication. The script is still a work in progress, but a working demonstration is available at this <a href="https://github.com/mussar0x4D5352/readable-nicephrases">GitHub repo.</a>. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this came from <a href="https://xkcd.com/936">xkcd</a>, a popular webcomic that infuses a heavy dose of math, computer science, and well-meaning cynicism into its format. The comic illustrates a critical flaw in most passwords: a 12 character password - the minimum recommended length for a cryptographically secure key - is either going to be easy to remember but easy to crack, or difficult to crack but difficult to remember. In some cases, like the example presented in the comic, you can get passwords that are easy to crack AND difficult to remember.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A passphrase, on the other hand, can be way longer while staying memorable. Even if the words are randomly selected, a phrase like "foul carrot check pirate" is going to stick into your mind. It's evocative, highly visual, and even without all the arbitrary requirements like mixed case and numbers, it would take millenia to try and brute force. I do think this could be improved, however - which is where Readable Nicephrases comes in.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This script uses two libraries - the <a href="https://github.com/moreati/python-niceware">python port</a> of niceware (a library originally written in javascript by <a href="https://github.com/diracdeltas/niceware">bcrypt</a>), an implementation of this style of passphrase generation which has provided the wordlist we're using, and the <a href="https://www.nltk.org">Natural Language Toolkit</a>, abbreviated NLTK, a machine learning library that can process and categorize sentences to "understand" how they fit together. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    NLTK processes the wordlist into different parts of speech - nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. From there, a sentence structure like "Noun Verb Noun" or "Adjective Noun Verb" is randomly selected and given randomly assigned words. This final section is the simplest process, and gives us passphrases like "a pretension contending guiltily". Memorable, but also rather poetic. There's improvements to be made, to be sure, but my hope is that we can help usher people away from less secure practices towards more secure ones, even if it involves a couple of roundabouts on the way there.
